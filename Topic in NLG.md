Topic can be viewed as a abstract representation associated with words, sentences and documents. It is regarded by most as a latent variable, and in those models, words are generated conditioning on that latent variable. Some higher-level parameters control the chosen of topics of a sentence or document, which are the object of the optimization process.

In mainstream work, a topic is not explicitly given by a pre-defined set. Rather it is understood by the whole vocabulary. Formally, a topic *k* is a vector *t^k* over the vocabulary *V*. The i-th element *t_i^k* corresbonds to the i-th word in *V*.
